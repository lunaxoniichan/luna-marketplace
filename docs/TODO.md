# Backlog

> Every row links to a plan file + phase. Deferred scope from `dev-plan` lands here.

| ID | Task | Plan file | Plan phase | Status |
|----|------|-----------|------------|--------|
| T1 | `plan-trailer-guard` PreToolUse (Bash) warn-hook: warns when a plan-worthy commit (feat/fix/refactor/perf) runs during an active plan (docs/PLANS.md active row) without a `Plan:` trailer. Fail-open; opt-out `LUNA_PLAN_TRAILER_GUARD=off`; mirrored in `.cursor/hooks.json`. | `docs/plans/2026-06-15-phase-1-review-fixes.md` | follow-up | done |
| T2 | Sharks-Loop MCP transport + optional GitHub Action CI gate (loop-coupled expansion tier). | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-sharks-loop.md` | phase-5 | deferred |
| T3 | Confirm remaining build-time decisions (staging Firebase vs emulator · identity_mode default · attempt-cap) before Sharks-Loop implementation. | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-sharks-loop.md` | phase-1 | blocked |
| T4 | Doc-lifecycle restructure — convention + buckets in Studio Phase 0; **promote/demote UI + skills** shipped (contract `docs/specs/2026-07-19-doc-lifecycle-promote-demote-contract.md`). | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-2 / phase-5 | done |
| T5 | Fleet sync (`sync-agent-views --all`) — generate plugin `rules/` into every registry project (ADR Option A). Contract: `docs/specs/2026-07-19-fleet-sync-contract.md` (active). | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-2 | done |
| T6 | Gateway hardening: per-vault mutation mutex, error normalization, body size cap, ctx env-gate. | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-2 | done |
| T7 | Phase 0 residuals: FM on architecture docs; surface `missing_frontmatter` in README health; content-aware `--check`. Delivered: H1 title fallback + `--check` fails on missing FM. | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-0 follow-up | done |
| T8 | Studio UI hint after `type: plan` demote/supersede: surface “plan archived — run `build-plans-registry.mjs`”. | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-2 follow-up | done |
| T13 | Shared-util consolidation — `scripts/lib/util.mjs` owns `sha256Text`, `today()`, `normalizeRelPath`, `GENERATED_MARKER`, and the knowledge-exclusion filter (was duplicated across libs). | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-4 follow-up | done |
| T9 | Dedupe assistant (lexical keyword pass, read-only) — contract + lib + Studio Dedupe tab. | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-2 Task 5 | done |
| T10 | Graph memory backend (Phase 3) — rebuildable file-JSON index, read-only query, fail-open local-ai, Studio Graph memory tab. Contract: `docs/specs/2026-07-19-graph-memory-backend-contract.md`. | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-3 | done |
| T11 | Optional Graphiti + FalkorDB enrichment adapters (still fail-open; file-JSON remains default). | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-3 follow-up | open |
| T12 | `recent_changes` is not recency-ordered (path order + shared `built_at`). Capture per-source git/mtime at rebuild and sort, or rename until recency is honest. | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-3 follow-up | done |
| T14 | Studio **production `next build`** now works: plugin libs are vendored into `studio/.plugin/scripts/` (gitignored, rebuilt on predev/prebuild via `scripts/vendor-studio.mjs`) so Turbopack resolves them inside `studio/` in both dev and prod. E2E smoke runs against `next build && next start`. | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-5 follow-up | done |
| T15 | OAM (open-agent-marketplace) follow-up — scope + decision before code (publish format, registry compatibility, per-vault boundaries). Deferred from Phase 5. | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-5 | deferred |
| T16 | Obsidian vault exporter — read-only projection shipped: `scripts/lib/obsidian-export.mjs` + CLI, gitignored `{vault}/.obsidian-export/`, reuses the shared corpus filter, remaps protected lessons visible. (Open: symlink-vs-copy + external-location.) | `docs/plans/2026-07-18-luna-studio.md` | phase-5 follow-up | done |
